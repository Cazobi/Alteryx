# Challenge 10

[Challenge description](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Weekly-Challenges/Challenge-1-Join-to-Range/m-p/36621/highlight/true#M25)

A distribution center receives a package. At the point of receipt, the package is scanned and a timestamp is captured for arrival date/time. The company is trying to reduce the amount of time the package is at its facility and as a result is trying to analyze how long packages remain at the facility.

The objective for this challenge is to calculate the delta between arrival date/time and the Time_Now field (this field has the date/time of the creation of this challenge and will be changing as time goes on). Create a unique field for Days, Hours, Minutes and Seconds.
