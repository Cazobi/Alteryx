# Challenge 4

[Challenge description](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Weekly-Challenges/Challenge-1-Join-to-Range/m-p/36621/highlight/true#M25)

A dataset contains a text field that has a date embedded within the text. The problem is that the date is represented a few different ways. For example:

16-APR-2005
Nov•16,•1900
4-SEP-00
Jan•5•2000
 
The goal is to create a new Date/Time field populated with the dates contained within the text field. You will also need to standardize the dates so that they are all formatted the same.
