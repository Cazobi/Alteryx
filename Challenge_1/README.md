# Challenge 1

[Challenge description](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Weekly-Challenges/Challenge-1-Join-to-Range/m-p/36621/highlight/true#M25)

A company in Australia has source data which is made up of a series of postal codes (eg. 2000, 2001, 2002 etc.) amongst some other data fields. They have a separate reference table which contains postcode ranges (eg. 2000 to 2002) which they would like to use to match/filter their main data.

Each Customer Record needs to be joined to the Lookup table based on a Postal Area Ranged region. Then finally summarize the customer data by Region, Sales Rep, and Responder, then a count of customers.

What I learned/practiced:
