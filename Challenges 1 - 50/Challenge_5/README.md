# Challenge 5

[Challenge description](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Weekly-Challenges/Challenge-1-Join-to-Range/m-p/36621/highlight/true#M25)

An HR department has a defined hierarchy for job identification across the organization. Depending on the job, the position within the hierarchy can change.

The goal is to create an analytical application that allows a HR rep to enter a position # (in this example, 33333) and return all records where the position is found within the hierarchy system.

What I learned/practiced:
* Building an application
* Creating Macrosa
